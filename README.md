This project is usedul to understand the concept of GIPHY API and the get/push methods, while combining JS and jQ and ajax. 

To start, think of a theme you would like to follow for your gif display and button suggestions. 
  1. initilize the GIPHY API and greate a variable to be called
  2. create an array - which will be used to create buttongs that will be displayed in the HTML as buttons
  3. when a button is clicked, the page will display 10 static, non-animated gifs from the GIPHY API
  4. when you click the gif, it will start to animate, and when clicked again it will stop.
  5. under every display, it will show it's rating/
  6. add a form to take submissions from the user which will add their own button and display it above the page with the other buttons. 
  


Any questions or concerns can be dealt with by googling or youtubing GIPHY API coding.
